# Changelog — Orbit Academy

`MAJOR.MINOR` versioning; each release passes the security audit in `docs/SECURITY.md` before push.

## v1.0 — 2026-07-10
First complete module + full course-management shell.

**Module 1 — How Orbits Work (complete):**
- Live two-body simulator: analytic conic orbits (no numerical drift), to-scale Earth,
  ISS/LEO/Starlink(inclined shells)/GPS(6 planes×4 @ 55°)/GEO, inject-your-own-object with
  altitude/speed/inclination, "fan" injection, GEO-lock-over-Colorado demo.
- Prograde/retrograde correct; GEO genuinely geostationary; time warp 1⁄32 → 64× with a
  wall-clock speed-up readout.
- Interactive worksheet: 11 tasks in a logical sequence (orient → what-makes-an-orbit →
  direction/speed law → geosync → inclination/launch geography), each with a check question +
  demo-specific remediation; auto-completes on correct answer; key-points summary + Wikipedia
  resources at the end.
- Shared controls reference page, linked from the header and an intro card.

**Course-management backend:**
- Accounts (scrypt-hashed passwords), sessions (HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict cookies).
- Per-task progress with resume; server-side prerequisite gating; pass threshold.
- First account = instructor; instructor roster dashboard.
- Zero dependencies; JSON-file store (gitignored).

**Security:** audit PASS (path traversal, auth, priv-esc, session integrity, prereq bypass,
input validation, DoS, XSS, secrets). See `docs/SECURITY.md`.

**Tests:** `bash test/run.sh` — 18 functional + 22 security checks + DoS guard, all passing.
See `docs/TESTING.md`. Reproducible, zero-dependency, isolated data file.
